# Rainwater Harvesting Model

This code is designed to enable others to replicate our work on the water security and reliability offered by rainwater capture systems. This work is described in our paper *Analytic Modeling of Rainwater Harvesting in the Brazilian Semiarid Northeast*, available at [dx.doi.org/10.1111/1752-1688.12376](dx.doi.org/10.1111/1752-1688.12376).
This code is not complete or perfect, and we welcome collaboration to improve it.
We request that if you are using this code or approach for your own work, you cite the above paper.
